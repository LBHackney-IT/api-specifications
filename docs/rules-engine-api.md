title: Rules Engine API
---

## Purpose

To provide a generic service for managing business rules as a reusable service. This service will act as a repository for business rules normally hardcoded into an application and provide a more flexible approach for managing these rules.
This service is designed to decouple business rules from applications and have a common source of rules for multiple services.

## Functions

- Record application rules as a separate service and abstracted away from applications to increase visibility of these rules.
- Allow business users to easily manage business rules used in an application.
- Improve flexibility of an application by extracting business rules management.

## Vision

- A single, centralised data source holding all business rules which can be updated by multiple services.
- A reusable microservices API for managing business rules.
- Reducing development cost and time.
- A decoupled architecture that allows this entity to be reused across multiple services.

## User needs

- As a business user I would like to be able to see the business rules of an application so that I can make changes to the rules as services and/or legislation change.
- As a developer or SME I would like to be able to manage business rules outside of the application so I can make changes to these rules without having to update the applicationâ€™s code base.
- As a manager I would like to know the history of business rules changes so that I know which rules applied at a particular given time.
