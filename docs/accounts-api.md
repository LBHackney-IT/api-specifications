title: Accounts API
---

## Purpose
To identify all information to be captured with regards to the Accounts domain. 
As part of our solution we are proposing to develop an Account entity and API that will serve accounts related data for our housing streams and any other projects that may require information relating to an account. This means that we can offer a deeper, more citizen-centric self-service capability, enabling even more service transactions to be carried out online. 
For the purposes of establishing context, the definition of an account as it relates to this entity is a record of a financial basis that links a user to a service. 

## Functions
- Accounts - Account information relating to a person or organisation.  This could be for a person’s rent account, benefit account or any other account a person (or organisation) may hold with the council.
- Accounts in arrears - Accounts in arrears categorised by account types (service charges, major works, secure tenancies, non-secure tenancies)

## Vision
A single, centralized data source, holding all account data, updated by multiple services.
A reusable microservice API used for managing account related data.
Avoidance of any duplication of data, a normalised view of an account.
Reducing development costs across all streams.
A decoupled architecture that allows this entity to be reused across multiple services.

## User Needs
- As a service user I would like to see what accounts I have for the various services I subscribe to with the council so that I can have a clear view of what my financial status is with regards to the council.
- As a service user I would like to see what my account balance is with each service that I subscribe to so that I can see what financial commitments I have.
- As a caseworker I would like to be able to quickly identify accounts that are in arrears so that I can prioritise cases that need to be actioned more effectively.
- As a developer, I want to:
    - Reuse a single Accounts microservice so that development efforts can be focused on other requirements.
    - Ensure data updated, retrieved and inserted is consistent across services and reliable.
    - Have an easy way to retrieve any data related to an account so that I don’t need to make additional calls to find references for related systems.

## Other considerations
- How do we reflect positive and negative activities on an account?  
- Do we need to supply an account balance at a specific date? - Let’s not do this.
- Do we want to have a further breakdown within this API of what makes up an account balance?

## Dependent Entities
- Tenants & Leaseholders
- Income Services
- Revenue & Benefits
